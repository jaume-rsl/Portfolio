# Physical training reporting
From a shared drive excel file, I was pulling current data on the marks achieved by all the members of my team.
Data is segmentated by age, level and individual.
KPIs relate the unit performance in relation with the upper unit marks to have context.
The polygon chart plots individual, own unit and related units performace by physical areas.
Joining all this visuals, I could assess a better training programme targeting lower performance individuals, focusing on weaker areas of physical training and making sure my unit accomplished better the training than the average neighbour units.

# Contracts monitoring
From a collection of excel files on a shared drive the dashboard plots the current and historical financial state of many contracts reported from different sources.
This gave the decision maker the proper insights to plan and execute many financial commitments with accurate and timely information.
