## Digital Transformation and Knowledge management (2020-current)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![under_construction](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/jaume-rsl/blob/d2fe9e9e4d973e7dbbc99aa49dacb8dc324e8039/images/under_construction.png) 

In my current position, in addition to my logistics analysis duties, I'm leading a mid-term project of digital transformation.
Since forever, I've been thinking that my organization is not using the technology properly. But lately, the amount of required information, the need for speed, and the data intoxication, made me aware of the urgency of a digital transformation to meet the needs of flexibility and leadership that the military demands. 
In 2016 I accessed the directive level so I had the opportunity to empower a true digital mindset across my area of influence.
In 2020 I landed in a position where my boss gave me a huge amount of freedom of action and autonomy.
Finding myself in this environment, I could only try to give my best and remove all unnecessary analog bureaucracy, enabling at the same time, a proper knowledge management system.

### Digital strategy

### Project Governance
Once the main stakeholders were in the project, I needed to stablish a  project governance.
My organization is a distributed unit across Spain, and I wanted to use agile methodologies, since I didn't know how the real output would look like in the end.
I ended with a hybrid governance design:
I chose Scrum+Kanban to lead a team of 9 "paladins" every sub-unit chose for digitalizing the processes.
The sprints are long, 1 month, but the organizations each one of them represents have an analog mindset, so I assumed they would operate in a traditional way. Being so, they needed time to plan and execute.
My role is some mixture of Product Owner and Scrum Master, but being a servant-leader and goal-oriented, I feel comforable with it.

I took respoonsibility for the backlog of MAAA 4.0 (such was the name decided for the product, which was the future "digital organization" we aimed at). The tool used for controlling the workflow is a Kanban board, plus some not-very-strict limitations of the WIP (work in progress), a must since there are times in which the developments are haulted due to external actors impossible to engage.
