## Digital Transformation and Knowledge management (2020-current)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![under_construction](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/jaume-rsl/blob/d2fe9e9e4d973e7dbbc99aa49dacb8dc324e8039/images/under_construction.png) 

In my current position, in addition to my logistics analysis duties, I'm leading a mid-term project of digital transformation.
Since forever, I've been thinking that my organization is not using the technology properly. But lately, the amount of required information, the need for speed, and the data intoxication, made me aware of the urgency of a digital transformation to meet the needs of flexibility and leadership that the military demands. 
In 2016 I accessed the directive level so I had the opportunity to empower a true digital mindset across my area of influence.
In 2020 I landed in a position where my boss gave me a huge amount of freedom of action and autonomy.
Finding myself in this environment, I could only try to give my best and remove all unnecessary analog bureaucracy, enabling at the same time, a proper knowledge management system.

### Digital strategy

### Stakeholder Management
From the very beginning of the project, the team analyzed who where the main stakeholders who could support the project.

Starting with the commander of the unit (CEO-equivalent), all of the stakeholders were briefed. After that, they are being managed in accordance with their individual interest in the project. That means reporting to some of them, collaborating with others, receiving feedback from a group of them and asking for guidance in some cases, all of it to accomplish the goal of kkep making prograss and moving forward in the transformation of the unit.

### Project Governance
Once the main stakeholders were in the project, I needed to stablish a  project governance.
My organization is a distributed unit across Spain, and I wanted to use agile methodologies, since I didn't know how the real output would look like in the end.
I ended with a hybrid governance design:
I chose Scrum+Kanban to lead a team of 9 "paladins" every sub-unit chose for digitalizing the processes.
The sprints are long, 1 month, but the organizations each one of them represents have an analog mindset, so I assumed they would operate in a traditional way. Being so, they needed time to plan and execute.
My role is some mixture of Product Owner and Scrum Master, but being a servant-leader and goal-oriented, I feel comforable with it.

I took respoonsibility for the backlog of MAAA 4.0 (such was the name decided for the product, which was the future "digital organization" we aimed at). The tool used for controlling the workflow is a Kanban board, plus some not-very-strict limitations of the WIP (work in progress), a must since there are times in which the developments are haulted due to external actors impossible to engage.

### Digital processess
I lead the modelling through BPMN of the analog processess (As-Is) and how they will be digitally implemented (To-Be). I can do modelling but I can also teach and coach on how to model. The result is a growing database of modeled processes, documenting the project goals in process reengineering.

### Digital Training/Coaching
A big part of my project is to train those who "have born analog".  

The main part of the training consists of helping individuals to fully understand the tools they already use (like Excel, Outlook, a network shared drive or a Sharepoint site). This enables them to be much more productive with a very small effort. At this stage is usually when people fully understand that they need to go digital, and hence I find truly engaged individuals who support the project.  

Once the kick-start is achieved, I guide them in upskilling. Some times I do "[pills](https://bit.ly/MenosDe5)", some times I refer them to on-line resources, other times I need to do an on-line training explaining the procedures or tools that I will put in place for them.

### Knowledge Management
Line of action #5 is Knowledge Management. KM (GIC in spanish), is the way chosen to achieve the goal of being a **learning organization**.

Having a high rate of rotation in personnel, the training and availability of knowledge are paramount to our mission. Taking advantatge of the digital tools at hand, mainly Sharepoint, we are able to share knowledge (both implicit and explicit) in a nation-wide network of experts.

Pushing hard to fight the resistance to change, and with the leadership of the main stakeholders, we are getting to a point in which we build communities to deal with common problems. These communities, share openly their findings, and work out loud to the rest of the members of the organization.


### Digital reporting
With the aim to remove all possible bureaucracy and to make more data-driven decisions, a BI reporting system is being put in place to replace the traditional reporting.

As soon as a process is digital, a Power BI report is designed to answer the questions that the decision-makers have. You can check out some of the reports in the [Power BI](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/blob/4f2cb8b5e4dbfd45ecd63e1a99d6aabcc889cb9a/Power%20BI/README.md) or [Excel](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/blob/4f2cb8b5e4dbfd45ecd63e1a99d6aabcc889cb9a/Excel/README.md) sections.

Since decision-makers and stakeholders are highly correlated, this helps even more to fight the friction (or the resistance to change). Once they try automated data-driven reports, they don't want to hear about traditional reporting anymore, since they realize that the speed and accuracy of traditional reporting is much worse.
