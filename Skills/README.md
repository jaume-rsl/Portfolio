# Skills I have
## Analytic mindset
Since an early age, my approach to knowledge was to break down into pieces every challenge I faced. My natural tendency to study science reinforced this behaviour.

Asking tons of questions in every topic to get to the root causes, split big topics into smaller pieces and analyzing this pieces and how they interconnect is a big hobby for me. I do it all the time with all kind of (mainly tech-related) topics.  

This has driven me to study data analytics to make better informed decisions in my daily duties.
