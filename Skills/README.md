# Skills I have
## Analytic mindset
Since an early age, my approach to knowledge was to break down into pieces every challenge I faced. My natural tendency to study science reinforced this behaviour.

Asking tons of questions in every topic to get to the root causes, split big topics into smaller pieces and analyzing this pieces and how they interconnect is like a big hobby for me. I do it all the time with all kind of (mainly tech-related) topics.  

This has driven me to study data analytics to make better informed decisions in my daily duties.

## Problem solving
Since 2008 my job has been to solve problems in creative manners.

I've been working in an organization that has to accomplish a lot with very limitted resources. Even if that's not an optimal situation, it boosts creativity.

I define myself as a cross-learner, which points to the ability of applying knowledge from an area to a completely different one. This capacity multipies the effects of thea creativity I apply in problem solving.
