# Portfolio

All right, let's show some cool stuff here!

You will find in this repo several folders, depending on which technology is used for the analysis. In each one of them, several files will show some work I've done.

## [Power BI](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/tree/main/Power%20BI)&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/assessed__level-Quite%20Good!-green?style=plastic&logo=powerbi)


The intent is to share .pbix files, so you can access the whole dataset and make good use of the report/dashboard. In case some data is business sensitive I will securize it and publish just some screenshots.

## [Excel](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/tree/main/Excel)&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/assessed__level-Fully-Skilled-success?style=plastic&logo=microsoftexcel)

The same is true here. If possible, I will publish the .xlsx. Otherwise, just some securized screenshots.


## [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/jaumerossello/code)&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/assessed__level-Quite%20Good!-green?style=plastic&logo=python)

Check my [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/jaumerossello/code) in which I publish all my progress. For now, you will find:

1. [Student Performance Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/jaumerossello/students-performance-analysis). In which I use Python libraries `pandas` and `seaborn` to gain insights into students performance in a series of math and language tests.
