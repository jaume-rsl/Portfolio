# Portfolio

All right, let's show some cool stuff here!

You will find in this repo several folders, depending on which technology is used for the analysis. In each one of them, several files will show some work I've done.

## [Power BI](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/tree/main/Power%20BI)


The intent is to share .pbix files, so you can access the whole dataset and make good use of the report/dashboard. In case some data is business sensitive I will securize it and publish just some screenshots.

## [Excel](https://github.com/jaume-rsl/Portfolio/tree/main/Excel)

The same is true here. If possible, I will publish the .xlsx. Otherwise, just some securized screenshots.


## Python

Check my [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/jaumerossello/code) in which I publish all my progress. For now, you will find:
